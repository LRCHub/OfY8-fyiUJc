The Punishment of Luxury
Is in the air for all to see
And it's ugly now
And it's getting worse every day
(Hey! hey! hey!)

Dilettantes savoir faire
Can I have my check please sir?
Cause I'm leaving now
Couldn't take it another day
(Hey! hey! hey!)

Think you're right? Think you're free?
Floating in your purgat'ry
But you made your choice
And you're living it every day
(Hey! hey! hey!)

Lazy Girl, Dirty Boy
Surrounded by your broken toys
And you don't know how
To make the pain just go away
(Hey! hey! hey!)

So close your eyes
And shut your mouth
You make me wanna
To scream and shout

So close your eyes
And shut your mouth
You make me want
To scream and shout

So close your eyes
And shut your mouth
You make me wanna
Scream and shout

(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

The Punishment of Luxury
Is in the Air for all to see
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

The Punishment of Luxury
Is in the Air for all to see
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

The Punishment of Luxury
Is in the Air for all to see
(Hey! Hey! Hey!) (For all to see!)

Punishment of Luxury
Is in the Air for all to see

(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
